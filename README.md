### Methods of Applied Psychology and Psychometrics in Geographical Analysis

Integrating applied psychological and psychometric methods into geographical analysis.
With the emergence of geo-referenced questionnaires, spatially explicit psychological 
and psychometric methods can offer a geographically contextualised approach that 
reflects latent traits and processes at a more local scale, leading to more tailored 
research and decision-making processes. The implemented methods include Geographically 
Weighted Cronbach's alpha and its bandwidth selection.
